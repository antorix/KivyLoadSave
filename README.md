# KivyLoadSave

Working demonstration of loading and saving data from/to device memory on Android in a Python/Kivy application. Tested on Android 6, 10, and 12 (Kivy 2.1.0).

The app allows to open any text file in your device memory and see its content in the text input field. You can also input any text yourself and save it as a new text file in the Documents folder on your device. In parallel, just for demonstration purposes, an .mp3 file is created and placed in the Music folder.
